# DataAnalysis_Project_01
Basically In this portfolio project I used updated data of covid-19. the file I used it has huge colums and so many rows so Break them down into two files.
As I have planned to work with vaccination and deaths that is why I made two files which contains related data.At first I have done basic sql queries.There are queries related to find specific answers for different questions.
I have created table , CTE, View and temp table.It's not that much hard but I enjoy to use SQL.
